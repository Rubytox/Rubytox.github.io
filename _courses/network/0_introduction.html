<p>Hello everyone and welcome to this course about computer networks.</p>

<p>This course aims at providing a complete set of information about computer networks, their history and the way they have been designed. It presents how the different parts of the Internet are interconnected and how the information is transmitted from a point to another. A goal of this course is also to view networking in terms of security and to give advices on security matters related to the different blocks of computer networks.</p>

<p>This course is organized as following:</p>
