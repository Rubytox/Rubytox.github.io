<p>Hello to everyone!</p>

<p>In this article, I'm presenting a little package I wrote for helping make outputs clearer in my Python scripts. This
    package's functions aren't really optimal, but they are sufficient for how I use them. This article is here to help
    uderstand some parts of my code that might be unclear because of the use of such functions.<!--more--></p>

<p>Basically, the package provides the four following displays:</p>
<img src="/img/article_{{ page.code}}/colors1.png" alt="Four displays" />

<p>Here is the code for the package:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
class Colors:
    BLACK = "\033[30m"
    RED = "\033[31m"
    GREEN = "\033[32m"
    YELLOW = "\033[33m"
    BLUE = "\033[34m"
    BOLD = "\033[1m"
    NONE = "\033[0m"
    BRED = BOLD + RED
    BGREEN = BOLD + GREEN
    BYELLOW = BOLD + YELLOW
    BBLUE = BOLD + BLUE

    @staticmethod
    def info(msg, end='\n'):
        print(Colors.BBYELLOW + "[~] " + str(msg) + Colors.NONE, end=end, flush=True)

    @staticmethod
    def success(msg, end='\n'):
        print(Colors.BGREEN + "[+] " + str(msg) + Colors.NONE, end=end, flush=True)

    @staticmethod
    def fail(msg, end='\n'):
        print(Colors.BRED + "[!] " + str(msg) + Colors.NONE, end=end, flush=True)

    @staticmethod
    def note(msg, end='\n'):
        print(Colors.BBLUE + "[*] " + str(msg) + Colors.NONE, end=end, flush=True)
</pre>

<p>It is very simple: just import the class <code>Colors</code> from the package and use one of the four static
    methods. The package comes as well with simplified codes for the basic colors I use in my script: we have black,
    red, green, yellow and blue. There is a variable for bold as well, and one that removes all decoration. Eventually,
    prefixing any color name with <code>B</code> represents the combination of the color in question and bold decoration.</p>

<p>For instance, the example script I ran in the picture above is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from colors import Colors

Colors.info("This is an information.")
Colors.success("Something went as expected!")
Colors.fail("Something went wrong.")
Colors.note("This is a note.")
</pre>

<p>That's all. This article is mostly to avoid any confusion if I use those functions in any of my scripts.</p>
