<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Today, I'm publishing a writeup for <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a>'s machine Forest, made by
    <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1190">egre55</a> and
    <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/2984">mrb3n</a>. This was the first machine running Windows
    I tried to own, and I would say it was really the hardest one for me now. However, I learned a lot about Active
    Directory here, so it was really useful.<!--more--></p>

<p>As usual, I'm going to add this machine's IP address to my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, and I will be refering to
    it using the domain name <code>forest.ctf</code>.</p>

<p>Let's get started! I started by running an <code>nmap</code> scan, which gave the following result:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

</pre>

<p>So we learn here that we're targetting a machine in an Active Directory system, whose domain is called
    <code>htb.local</code> and fully qualified domain name is <code>FOREST.htb.local</code>.</p>

<p>In order to get a foothold, I started by enumerating the users on the AD system, using a tool from
    <a href="https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket">Impacket</a>. Impacket is a collection of
    Python scripts that allow to perform a lot of various actions targetting AD systems. Here, we're going to use
    the tool <code>samrdump.py</code>: this script tries to enumerate all the users by communicating with the SAMR
    (<em>Security Account Manager Remote</em>) of the MSRPC. We know that it might work because we saw in the <code>nmap</code>
    scan that there was an MSRPC service running on port 135.</p>

Found user: santi, uid = 1152
Found user: mftuser, uid = 7601
</pre>

<p>So there are a lot of pointless users, and some accounts that look like actual users: sebastien, lucinda, svc-alfresco,
    andy, mark and santi. Of course there is the Administrator account, that we want to own at the end.</p>

<p>Here, every user might be interesting, but I'm going to start by looking at <code>svc-alfresco</code>: the <code>svc</code>
    usually stands for "service", so this user should be a service user. This user is interesting because I learned by looking
    at some "Best practice guides" regarding AD that there were a lot of administrators who gave service accounts higher
    privileges than they needed, so it might be an interesting way to start pentesting.</p>

<p>Another way to find a list of users could be using the LDAP service, with the tool <code>ldapsearch</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ldapsearch -h forest.ctf -x -b "dc=htb,dc=local"
</pre>

<p>We specify the hostname, then the option <code>-x</code> avoids using SASL authentification method, and we specify
    which domain controller we should retrieve information from with <code>-b</code>. This gives a lot of information,
    but I'm not sure most of it is actually useful, for <code>svc-alfresco</code> we only get this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
# svc-alfresco, Service Accounts, htb.local
dn: CN=svc-alfresco,OU=Service Accounts,DC=htb,DC=local
</pre>

<p>So it allowed us to know which OU (<em>Organisational Unit</em>) is the user member of, but nothing more. Now, I
    was stuck for a while because I didn't really know how to attack the account; I tried using <code>smbmap</code> and
    <code>smbclient</code>, but it led to nothing. </p>

<p>Browsing through the scripts from Impacket, I found a script that helped me a lot: <code>GetNPUsers.py</code>. Basically,
    one possible way to connect to an AD is to use the Kerberos protocol. Instead of using clear-text passwords, this authentication
    protocol relies on the use of symmetric keys and tickets. The tickets are delivered by a service called TGS (<em>Ticket
    Granting Service</em>), and this is this service we are going to send a request to. Find more information on
    <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocole)">Kerberos' Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The script <code>GetNPUsers.py</code> asks the TGS for a ticket (called TGT), and displays it if the targeted user has the property
    'Do not require Kerberos preauthentication' set.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> If so, then we will be able
    to exploit the TGT and get the user's password. Let's try that:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ GetNPUsers.py htb.local/svc-alfresco@forest.ctf -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.10.161

</pre>

<p>We then crack this TGT using <code>john</code> and the wordlist <code>rockyou</code>. Let's put the hash in a file
    names <code>svc-alfresco.tgt</code>, when then just have to run this command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

Session completed
</pre>

<p>We got a password! Now, in order to get the user flag, we need to login to <code>svc-alfresco</code>'s session. To do
    so, we can use a Windows machine and run the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ runas /user:htb.local\svc-alfresco powershell.exe
</pre>

<p>If you don't have a Windows machine ready, you can do that using Linux with the powerful tool <a href="https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm">
    Evil-WinRM</a>. This tools allows to have a Powershell session, and to upload and download files easily. We use this to
    login to user <code>svc-alfresco</code>'s session:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ evil-winrm -i forest.ctf -u "svc-alfresco" -p "s3rvice"

</pre>

<p>Great, we owned user! Now, let's get working on root. To do so, I'm going to use a very useful tool in AD and that is
    a bit hard to understand at first: <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">BloodHound</a>.</p>

<p>This software uses graph theory in order to analyze the relations between AD objects, and find interesting attack
    paths. It relies on a <a href="https://neo4j.com">neo4j</a> SGBD, so you might want to install this utility before
    using BloodHound.</p>

<p>However, if we launch BloodHound just like that, it won't help you lots because you first need to give it data to
    process. I know two ways of doing so:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a BloodHound's version which is Python based and that connects directly to the target, provided correct
         credentials, and gathers all needed information: this can be found <a href="https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py">here</a>.</li>
    <li>There is a separate BloodHound ingestor called SharpHound. It comes in two version: an executable file that can be
        uploaded to the host then ran, and a Powershell script that we're going to use right into Evil-WinRM. You can find
        SharpHound <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound3">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I'll be using the second method. First, I downloaded the script <code>SharpHound.ps1</code> in a directory called
    <code>scripts</code>, then I launched an Evil-WinRM session with the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ evil-winrm -i forest.ctf -u "svc-alfresco" -p "s3rvice" -s "scripts/"
</pre>

<p>Then, inside Evil-WinRM, I can load a Powershell script by typing its name in the prompt. The functions it declares
    will be added to Evil-WinRM's menu. We can observe that this way:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

[+] Bypass-4MSI
[+] Dll-Loader
[+] Donut-Loader
[+] Invoke-Binary
[+] Invoke-BloodHound
</pre>

<p>Here, we see that we can call the function <code>Invoke-BloodHound</code>. This function is going to gather all the
    information we need:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
<span class="evil-winrm-prefix"></span> C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -JSONFolder '.'
</pre>

<p>After a while, this method call will generate a zip file in the current directory named <code>datehour_BloodHound.zip</code>.
    Download this file using the <code>download</code> function, now we can exploit that.</p>

<p>First, we need to start <code>neo4j</code> using the command <code>./neo4j start</code> in the binary directory it was
    installed or built in. Then, launch BloodHound. A login screen should appear: it asks for the credentials for <code>neo4j</code>.
    Once logged in, you should have an interface similar to this one:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/forest1.png" alt="BloodHound blank interface" />

<p>Here, the database should be empty, so we're going to populate it. Click on the "Upload Data" button on the top right set
    of buttons, and upload the zip file we've downloaded earlier from the machine. After a while, data should be in
    the database as you can see here:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/forest2.png" alt="Populated database" />

<p>Then, we're going to see if BloodHound found an interesting path towards the Administrator account. To do so, we click
    on the "Queries" tab, and click on "Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins". BloodHound shows the following graph:</p>

<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/forest3.png" alt="Path to Domain Admins from svc-alfresco" />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful to the data you get from the host you attack. One possible privilege escalation method
    here is to create a new user, and at first BloodHound showed my a path using the new user other people created instead
    of the real interesting path.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> for some reason, the binary release version of BloodHound didn't work on my computer, it didn't put anything
    in the database. However, I built BloodHound from sources and this worked better.</p>

<p>So we see that our BloodHound found a way to get to Administrator starting from the user <code>svc-alfresco</code>. For now,
    I didn't use BloodHound much more because I still had some trouble understanding how it works and what it was showing
    me. However, I came across a tool that reads the paths found by BloodHound, and that was able to modify ACL permissions
    when applicable: <a href="https://github.com/fox-it/aclpwn.py"><code>aclpwn</code></a>.</p>

<p>We know that we have an exploitable route from <code>svc-alfresco</code>, so we can exploit it using the command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ aclpwn -f svc-alfresco -ft user -d htb.local -du svc-alfresco -s 10.10.10.161

</pre>

<p>We see that <code>aclpwn</code> found two paths that allows it to add <code>svc-alfresco</code> to an interesting group. From there,
    user <code>svc-alfresco</code> is part of the group <code>EXCHANGE TRUSTED SUBSYSTEM</code>. This will allow us to use
    another tool from Impacket: <code>secretsdump.py</code>. This tool dumps credentials or hashes found in the machine, but
    is useful only with enough permissions. We run it the following way:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">

</pre>

<p><code>secretsdump.py</code> gave us the NTLM hash for Administrator user! We can now try to connect to the machine
    using Evil-WinRM again:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u 'Administrator' -H "32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6"

</pre>

<p>We got root! So to sum it up, I think that Forest was a really difficult box, but mostly because AD and Windows
    pentesting is completely new to me. I learned a lot of new concepts, and I think I improved a lot about
    Windows boxes. However, I still think I didn't understand everything, as I can't really explain some things or
    commands I used.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> do not forget to restore the changes you did with <code>aclpwn</code>. When using <code>aclpwn</code>,
    the utility told us that a restore file has been saved under the name <code>aclpwn-20200322-130933.restore</code>. To
    use it, we simply use the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ aclpwn -f svc-alfresco -ft user -d htb.local -du svc-alfresco -s 10.10.10.161 --restore aclpwn-20200322-130933.restore

</pre>

<p>Here, we see that the restore didn't work because maybe the system was reset before I used it, or any other possibility.
    However, you should always do that after using <code>aclpwn</code> in order not to make the work too easy for the other
    pentesters.</p>

<p>So this is over for this box! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Rubytox/Rubytox.github.io">this website's GitHub page</a>.</p>
