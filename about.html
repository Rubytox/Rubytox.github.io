    <p>I am Christophe Néraud, a french 3rd year (Master's last year) student at <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">Grenoble INP - Ensimag</a>. I am pursuing a double degree in Cybersecurity with <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">Université Grenoble Alpes</a>.
        I have always been interested in IT Security, but I never really got started in this field before two years ago. In the
        first semester of year 2019-2020, I had a System and Network Security class, where I learned a lot of practical things
        such as basics in digital forensics, cryptography and related matters. In 2020, I am pursuing a Cybersecurity Master's degree, fully taught in English, where I gained skills in cryptography, software and hardware security, security architectures and security audit.</p>

    <p>I was quickly passionated by all those courses, and I wanted to learn more about the subject. I made a lot of personal
        researches, and created an account on challenges platforms such as <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a>
        and <a href="https://www.root-me.org">Root-me</a>. I learned a lot on those websites, and I want to keep improving in
        the field of pentest. This is why I decided to create this website, whose goal is for me to write walkthroughs about
        machines and challenges I complete, as well as posting articles on interesting concepts I learn about IT Security.</p>

    <p>To get my engineering degree, I must get an internship in a field related to Cybersecurity.
        I would love to have the opportunity to do this internship in an IT Security team working in security audit and pentest. 
        My internship must last between five and six months, starting from February 2020. 
        Autonomous and rigourous, I am confident in my abilities and I think I can be useful for your activity.</p>
