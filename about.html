    <p>I am Christophe NÃ©raud, a french 2nd year (Master's first year) student at <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">Grenoble INP - Ensimag</a>.
        I have always been interested in IT Security, but I never really got started in this field before this year. In the
        first semester of year 2019-2020, I had a System and Network Security class, where I learned a lot of practical things
        such as basics in digital forensics, cryptography and related matters.</p>

    <p>I was quickly passionated by this course, and I wanted to learn more about the subject. I made a lot of personal
        researches, and created an account on challenges platforms such as <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a>
        and <a href="https://www.root-me.org">Root-me</a>. I learned a lot on those sites, and I want to keep improving in
        the field of pentest. This is why I decided to create this website, whose goal is for me to write walkthroughs about
        machines and challenges I complete, as well as posting articles on interesting concepts I learn about IT Security.</p>

    <p>To complete my current year, I must get a summer internship in a field related to Computer Science Engineering
        in general, and I would love to have the opportunity to do this internship in an IT Security team. My internship
        must last between two and four months, starting from 8th June 2020: I am aware that usually companies prefer doing
        at least six-months long internships; however that's not possible for me until next year. I am confident in my
        abilities and I think I can still be useful even in a short amount of time.</p>
