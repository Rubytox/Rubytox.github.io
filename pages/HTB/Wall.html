    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

    <p>So about a week and a half ago, I decided that I would try to own my first box on Hackthebox.
        I wanted to start with an easy one, so I chose Wall because a lot of people were saying this box was rather easy to own.
        It was a really interesting first experience as I learned a lot of things, even if I had to look for a lot of clues and hints because there are a lot of concepts
        I couldn’t think of by myself.</p>

    <p>Before we start, I just want to say that this walkthrough might not be as a usual one: I will talk about what I tried, even if it didn’t work, and
        I try to explain why what I did didn’t work, so it might be long and become kind of uninteresting at some point.
        However, I think it is really instructive about what mistakes you maybe didn’t but might do at some point.</p>

    <p>So, let’s get started! First, to make things easier I updated <code>/etc/hosts</code> in order to associate the IP address
        10.10.10.157 with the name <code>wall.ctf</code>. Then, I used <code>nmap</code> to get the machine open ports, which gave me the following result:</p>
    <pre><code>
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC wall.ctf

    <p>Here is a nice snippet, look at it!</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;cmath&gt;

        int main() {
            return 0;
        }
    </pre>
