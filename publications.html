                This article is a report of a project from the Software Security class I took during my Master's last year. This paper presents a brief introduction to the concept of metamorphic programming, provides an example and lists some countermeasures against metamorphic viruses. This work has been made with <a href="http://doyko.xyz">Benjamin Bihanic</a>.
